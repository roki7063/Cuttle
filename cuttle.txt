Cuttle
By: Richard Sipie

You win by getting 21 points.

A draw occurs if the deck runs out, and three "draw a cards" (=pass) are done in a row.

On your turn you may:

1. Draw a card.
2. Play a point card.
3. Scuttle a point card - discard a higher value card to destroy a lower value card on the field. (Aces are low, Clubs > Diamonds > Hearts > Spades)
4. Use a point card for a one-off effect.
5. Play a royal for a permanent effect.

== One-Off Effects (Point Cards)
Ace: Destroy all point cards.
Two: Destroy any non-point card. OR Counter any one-off effect (can be played at any time, including on opponent's turn.)
Three: Take a card from the discard.
Four: Opponent discards two cards from their hands.
Five: Draw two cards.
Six: Destroy all non-point cards.
Seven: Draw a card, and play it if possible.
Eight: NONE
Nine: Take any card in play, and put it on top of the deck.
Ten: NONE

== Permanent Effects (Royals)
Eight: Glasses, opponent plays with hand face up.
Jack: Place on top of a point card, which switches sides.
Queen: None of your other cards may be specifically targeted (by jacks, twos and nines.)
King: Owner only needs 14 points to win. (2 kings: 10, 3 kings: 7, 4 kings: 5)
